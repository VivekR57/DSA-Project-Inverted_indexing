An inverted index is a data structure commonly used in search engines and information retrieval systems to support fast and efficient full-text searching. It essentially maps terms (words) in the corpus of documents to the list of documents where those terms appear. This enables rapid searching by quickly locating which documents contain a given word, instead of having to scan each document individually.
Purpose of an Inverted Index:
Fast Full-Text Search: The primary purpose of an inverted index is to enable quick searching for words in large volumes of text. When a search query is made (e.g., "find documents containing the word 'apple'"), the inverted index allows the system to efficiently retrieve a list of documents that contain the word "apple", without needing to scan every document in the database.

Efficient Query Processing: It allows users to search for exact words or phrases across large datasets (e.g., documents, web pages, or articles) and return relevant results quickly. It improves the speed and scalability of searches, particularly when working with large datasets.

Supports Complex Queries: Inverted indexes can be extended to support more complex searches, including:

Phrase queries (e.g., searching for "apple pie" as a phrase).
Boolean queries (e.g., searching for documents containing both "apple" and "banana").
Wildcard or fuzzy searches.
Storage and Efficiency: The index allows for efficient storage and retrieval, reducing the need to re-scan documents for each query. Once the index is created, subsequent searches are performed against it, which speeds up query processing significantly.
